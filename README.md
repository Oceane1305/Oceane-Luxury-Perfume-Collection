# Oceane-Luxury-perfume-collection
 A curated, visually elegant webpage displaying my personal collection of luxury fragrances. This project brings together clean design, simple front‑end development, and a passion for high‑end perfumery. 

 This project is inspired by luxury beauty branding, editorial layouts, and the art of fragrance storytelling. The goal is to create a digital gallery where each perfume is presented with its brand, notes, bottle design, and story; transforming a hobby into an interactive experience.
 
This project was created to:
- Practice front‑end development
- Build a visually appealing personal project
- Showcase my interest in luxury fragrances
- Experiment with UI/UX inspired by premium brands
